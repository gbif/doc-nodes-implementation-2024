[[plans-priority-1]]
=== Priority Area 1

==== Andorra

New scientific monitoring programmes have been set up, and we need to continue and also launch new participatory science programmes (collaboration with the Government of Andorra should facilitate this). There has also been a delay in integrating the data into the GBIF (see below).

[[acb-1]]
==== ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity

To continue and expand the technical capacity building and data mobilization in Southeast Asia.

==== Australia

===== Activity 1.1

Test the GBIF eDNA tool and publish eDNA data. Study in more detail the advantages and disadvantages of implementing DOIs at national level together with other research institutions. Create and follow discussion of research/working groups on FAIR and CARE principles at a national and international level. Automate publishing and updating of occurrence and ecological data in SiBBr and implement test with the new GBIF data model and Humboldt extension. In addition, work together with the group on vectors of human desases by organizing a symposium on vector data and seek for more funding to continue the development of the PREVIR application that allows the collection of virus data in different animals and automatic standardization for publication in the IPT.

==== Cameroon

==== Australia

===== 4.1 

Robustness of GBIF infrastructure: ALA and GBIF have developed and active and collaborative working relationship over the past few years and this will continue in 2023. ALA will continue to collaborate on projects related to the unified data model, and continue to develop the Events system built during 2022. 

===== 4.2

Services for data publishers and users: A significant piece of work planned for 2023 is to update, better integrate and fully revise the taxonomic backbone used by ALA and the code underlying how it is built. New requirements have emerged from the Biosecurity and Restricted Access Species projects that mean that the taxonomic backbone must be much more rigorously built, governed and maintained than it has been in the past. A subject matter expert has been engaged to lead the project and an additional developer is being recruited. We hope to form an active collaboration with the Catalogue of Life and with GBIF to ensure that species found in Australia are represented accurately in the taxonomic schema.

===== 4.3

Enhance features and capabilities: ALA will continue work on the prototype implementation of the Events-based presentation of data. ALA will also actively participate in the further development of the unified data model and how it might be implemented for exemplar data such as genomic data, eDNA and machine observations.

===== 4.4 

Drive data standards development: An ALA staff member is now the Chair of the TDWG Executive during 2023-2024 so this will encourage a standards-focus for the ALA team.
